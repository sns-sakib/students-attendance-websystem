Project Description:
I made this project with the base of static condition of PSTU attendance system. An online
Attendance Management System is an innovative way to monitor and track the attendance of students.
Also this provides a transparency in the system so that each student can view their attendance from
anywhere, anytime. This is a simple yet intuitive attendance management system for university
teachers. Teachers can create an account, add their students, courses and the units they teach and enter
studentsâ€™ attendance record. The system admin can view all the attendance records for all units, but
teachers only view their own records.

Features:
